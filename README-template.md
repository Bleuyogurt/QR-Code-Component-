## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt how to center a div (popular developer joke)
-Use relative unit as against fixed ones
-Create variables that are reusable as root components
-Also learnt how images behave, they could be a bit tricky but I soon got a hang of it.

### Continued development

I would love to continue developing a developers eye. That is using my eyes to examine items on a wwebsite and getting close to precise measurement along side improve my overall developement skill
